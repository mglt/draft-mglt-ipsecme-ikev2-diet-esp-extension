Internet-Draft                EHC extension                November 2024


2.  Introduction

   The ESP Header Compression Profile (EHCP) [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp]
   minimizes the overhead associated with ESP by compressing both the
   ESP and additional fields within the secured packet.  EHCP utilizes
   Attributes for Rules Generation (AfRG) that are specified for each
   Security Association (SA).  Certain AfRG have already been
   established during the SA negotiation process through IKEv2.  This
   extension facilitates the agreement on the remaining AfRG through
   IKEv2 . # Protocol Overview

   As illustrated in Figure 1, an initiator intending to utilize the
   Header Compression Profile (HCP) informs its peer by sending a
   HCP_SUPPORTED Notify Payload during the IKE_AUTH and CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchanges.  The HCP_SUPPORTED includes a list of Proposal payloads,
   each comprising an EHCP Name along with a set of Attributes for Rules
   Generation (AfRG)[I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp].  Any AfRG for which the
   initiator has no limitations SHOULD be excluded.  A given AfRG MAY be
   repeated with different values in order to provide a list of
   acceptable values.  A range of possible AfRG value MAY be indicated
   as well.

   Proposals that contain an unknown HCP Name or any of the specified
   AfRG must be disregarded by the initiator.  If none of the received
   Proposals are deemed acceptable, the responder may choose to
   disregard the HCP_SUPPORTED Notify Payload.  Nevertheless, it is
   anticipated that the responder will provide an explanation for
   rejecting all HCP Proposals.  Should the reason pertain to an AfRG
   with an unacceptable value, the responder should reply with an
   HCP_UNSUPPORTED Notify Payload.  This Notify Payload should include
   one or more acceptable Proposal Payloads to guide the initiator.

   Conversely, if the receiver identifies a suitable Proposal, it will
   respond with a HCP_SUPPORTED Notify Payload that includes the chosen
   Proposal.  In cases where the AfRG was not explicitly stated, the
   responder will provide the AfRG unless it defaults to a standard
   value.  Each AfRG MUST NOT be mentioned more than one time.  When
   multiple values are provided for a specific AfRG either multiple
   values being provided or via a range of acceptable values, the
   receiver MUST NOT provide more than one values.  The Proposal MUST
   NOT contain any range of AfRG.

   Upon receipt of an HCP_UNSUPPORTED Notify Payload, the initiator has
   the option to restart the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.

   When the initiator receives the HCP_SUPPORTED Notify Payload, it will
   evaluate the Proposal to ensure it aligns with the initial proposal
   and adheres to its policies prior to executing the HCP.

     Figure 1: The parameters for Diet-ESP have been established
  through the HCP_SUPPORTED Notify exchange.  In this instance, the

           AfRG will default to their predetermined values.

                   Figure 4: Transform Attribute Payload

   There are two types of AfRG: 1) AfRG that are specific to a given HCP
   and 2) generic AfRG.

   This specification defines range_afrg_proposal as a Generic Attribute
   for Rules Generation to specify that a given AfRG can be selected
   within a range of value.

   *  Designation: range_afrg_proposal

   *  Has Associated Data: YES (AF=0)

   *  Attribute Data: Let AfRG_min and AfRG_max the minimum and maximum
      values of the proposed range, expressed following the Transform
      Attribute Payload format.  The corresponding Attribute Data is the
      concatenation of AfRG_min and AfRG_max.

5.  Registrating a Header Compression Profile

   An HCP needs to register a HCP Name in Section 7.3, the specification
   that describes the operations of the EHCP, as well as the different
   AfRG.  For each AfRG, the corresponding Attribute Type, the AF value,
   the Attribute Data and the Default Value MUST be specified.

6.  Registration of Diet-ESP EHCP

   This section defines the code points that are needed to agree the
   AfRG between two IKEv2 peers as described in Section 5.

   *  HCP Name: "Diet-ESP" as specified in Section 7.3.

   *  Specification : [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-diet-esp]

   The following Attributes for Rules Generation are defined:

   DSCP Compression/Decompression Action (CDA)

   *  Designation: dscp_cda

   ECN Compression/Decompression Action (CDA)

   *  Designation: ecn_cda

   *  Has Associated Data: YES (AF=0)

   *  Attribute Data: ECN CDA takes discrete values coded over one byte
      as described in the ECN CDA Value Registry Section 7.5.2

   *  Default Value: the default value is set to "uncompress"

   Flow Label Compression/Decompression Action (CDA)

   *  Designation: flow_label_cda

   *  Has Associated Data: YES (AF=0)

   *  Attribute Data: Flow Label CDA takes discrete values coded over
      one byte as described in the Flow Label CDA Value Registry
      Section 7.5.3

   *  Default Value: the default value is set to "uncompress"

   OS or Network Bit Alignment

   *  Designation: alignment

   *  Has Associated Data: YES (AF=0)

   *  Attribute Data: Byte Alignment takes discrete values coded over
      one byte as described in the Bit Alignment Value Registry
      Section 7.5.4

   *  Default Value: the default value is set to "32 bit" which
      correspond to the standard IPv6 bit alignment

   Security Policy Index (SPI) Least Significant Bits (LSB)

Internet-Draft                EHC extension                November 2024


   *  Attribute Data: SPI LSB designates the number of bits that are
      provided to infer the SPI.  This number is between 0 and 32.

   *  Default Value: the default value is 32 which is the size of the
      standard ESP

   Sequence Number (SN) Least Significant Bits (LSB)

   *  Designation: esp_sn_lsb

   *  Has Associated Data: YES (AF=0)

   *  Attribute Data: SN LSB designates the number of bits that are
      provided to infer the SPI.  This number is between 0 and 32.

   *  Default Value: the default value is 32 which is the size of the
      standard ESP

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of IKEv2 Notify Message Types

   IANA has allocated two values in the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types -
   Status Types" registry:

     Value    Notify Messages - Status Types
   -----------------------------------------
     TBA1    HCP_SUPPORTED
     TBA2    HCP_UNSUPPORTED

   This specification requests the IANA to create an IKEv2 Header
   Compression registry (see Section 7.3), as well as the necessary
   registries for the ESP Header Compression Profile Diet-ESP, that is
   the Attribute for Rules Generations (see Section 7.4 as well as, when
   required, the complementary specific AfRG Values associated to each
   AfRG (see Section 7.5).

   All registries are "Specification Required".

7.2.  Registry for Generic Attributes for Rules Generation

   Registry for Generic Attributes for Rules Generation.  When
   Associated Data is set to YES, the AF bit of the corresponding
   Transform Attribute Payload is set to 0 and 1 otherwise.  The AfRG
   Code Point mentioned here MUST NOT be reused by any Registries
   associated to any Profile and are shared bu all profiles.

8.  Security Considerations

   The protocol defined in this document does not modify IKEv2.

   Proposals may expressed in various ways and may be expressed in a
   specific way so its treatment overload the receiver.  The receiver
   needs to consider aborting the exchange when too much resources are
   required.
